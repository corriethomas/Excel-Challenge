# Excel-Challenge

Using the Excel file provided:
- Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the 'State' column with a different color depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live.
- Create a new column called 'Percent Funded' and use a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach it's initial goal.
- Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the 'Percent Funded' column using a three-color scale.
- Create a new column called 'Average Donation' and use a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.
- Create two new columns called 'Category' and 'Sub-Category' and use formulas to split the 'Category and Sub-Category' column into two parts.
- Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per **category**.
- Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table created.
- Create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per **sub-category**.
- Creae a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table created.
- Create a new column called 'Date Created Conversion' that will convert the data contained within 'launched_at' into Excel's date format.
- Create a new column called 'Date Ended Conversion' that will convert that data contained within 'deadline' into Excel's date format.
- Create a new sheet with a pivot table with a 'State' column, 'Date Created Conversion' rows, based on the count of 'State', and filters based on 'parent category' and 'Years'.
- Create a pivot chart line graph that visualizes this new table.
- Create a report in Word answering the following questions: 1) Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns? 2) What are some limitations of this dataset? 3) What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

# Bonus
- Create a new sheet with 8 columns: Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled.
- Using COUNTIFS(), count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created within the ranges: Less than 1000, 1000-4999, 5000-9999, 10000-14999, 15000-19999, 20000-24999, 25000-29999, 30000-34999, 35000-39999, 40000-44999, 45000-49999, Greater or equal to 50000.
- Add up the values in the 'Number Successful', 'Number Failed', and 'Number Canceled' columns to populate the 'Total Projects' column. Use a mathematical formula to find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.
- Create a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancelation.
